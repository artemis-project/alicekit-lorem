Lorem is the official demo application for AliceKit, the toolchain that allows for the creation of beautiful apps and extensions using the Swift programming language and Qt.

## Building
**Lorem** is a certified AliceKit app and follows the same build instructions for any AliceKit app, which can be found in the [AliceKit building instructions](BUILDAK.md).

To automate the process, you can run ```akdebug.sh```, which will automatically build the app and run it.
